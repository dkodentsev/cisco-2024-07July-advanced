    "# Assignment in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In a language like C, a variable is an alias to a location in memory. So when I assign to a variable, the value is being put in a particular location in memory. This is why we need to (a) declare our variables as having a certain type and (b) only certain types can be assigned to certain variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables refer to values.  Variables are *not* memory locations! All values are objects, and all objects are on the heap. A variable is just a *pointer* to one of those values. This is why any Python variable can refer to any Python value, and why we don't (and cannot) declare our variables to be a particular type.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the definition of a *dynamic language*.  It doesn't mean that values don't have types. It just m"
